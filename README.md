# Ensea in the Shell

## Introduction
**Ensea in the Shell** is a shell project developed as part of the 2nd-year Computer Science Major Synthesys Practical Work at ENSEA. The purpose of the project is to implement a tiny shell capable of executing commands and displaying information such as execution time and exit codes.

This repository contains the code, documentation, and report for the project, completed by Kyle DOTTIN and Reem KHATER.

## Objectives
- Create a micro shell named `enseash`.
- Implement features progressively, starting with a welcome message and a prompt.
- Display exit codes and execution times for executed commands.
- Avoid using `printf`, relying instead on `write()` for outputs.
- Follow best practices in coding, including modular design, meaningful comments, and English-language variable names.
